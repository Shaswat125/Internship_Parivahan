### Web Scrapper Tool

The PostRequest.py helps to post a request at https://parivahan.gov.in/rcdlstatus/?pur_cd=101 with given DL Number and DOB. Run it using python idle. 
But it also needs a captcha, so for now, it only brings all the contents of the Parivahan website after a post request. 
The CommandLineUtility.py does the same post request thing using command line. This runs on command line using:
```bash
python .\CommandLineUtility.py --dl_No DL-0420110149646 --dob 09-02-1976 --find res
```
The ScrapperUsingXpath.py scraps the contents of the website using xpath and lxml. Just run the file independently to scrap the details according to the given xpath.
